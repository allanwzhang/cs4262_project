# Melanoma Detection with Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the code and paper submission for a research project focusing on enhancing melanoma detection using machine learning techniques. The project investigates various models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Logistic Regression, and Transfer Learning with the ResNet-18 architecture. Each model is implemented and evaluated using the Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset.
